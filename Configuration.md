After installing WebTools.bundle, it needs to be configured

* Click on the WebTools.bundle icon from within the Plex Media Server Web Interface
* Click on the "gear" icon almost on the top right
* Enter the port you want the http server to listen on, and select save

**Note**
Sadly, PMS will now show a spinner forever on some platforms, so you may need to restart PMS.
You are now ready to rock, so browse to:

`http://"IP Address of PMS":<Port from above>`
