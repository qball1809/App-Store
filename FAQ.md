* I manually installed Webtools, but when PMS is restarted, the WebTools.bundle directory is removed?
  * Most likely, you also installed WebTools under the `Resource/Plug-ins-XXXX`directory as well. You must delete it from that, and the manually reinstall WebTools in the [`Library/Plug-Ins`](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201106098) directory
* When I browse to `http://IP_OF_PMS:33400` nothing happens
  * Make sure, that you opened your PMS firewall to port 33400 and 33443
