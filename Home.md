Welcome to the WebTools.bundle wiki!

This bundle is a plugin for the [Plex Media Server](https://plex.tv/) that will assist you in maintaning your subtitle files, regardless of them been sidecars (Located next to the media file), or downloaded via another plugin, like the OpenSubtitle bundle.

What this plugin can do, is that it will allow you to gather an overview of subtitles for a media, view them, and delete them, unless they are embedded within the media itself.
