# ![Logo](https://github.com/ukdtom/WebTools.bundle/blob/master/Wiki/WebTools/Logos/WebTools-48x48.png) Installing WebTools

If you are running Windows, Asustor, QNAP or Synology, you will find easy to install packages here:
[Web Tools Installer](https://github.com/ukdtom/WTInstaller/releases/latest)

### Manual Installation
If you want/need to install WebTools manually, follow these steps:

* [Download WebTools here](https://github.com/dagalufh/WebTools.bundle/releases/latest) 
* Extract all files from the zip file
* Copy the extracted files to the [Plug-ins directory](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201106098)
* Make sure the directory is named WebTools.bundle (and **NOT** WebTools.bundle-master)
* Make sure the WebTools.bundle directory contains a directory named "Contents". If not, then you might be one directory too high!
* If running Linux or Mac OS X, also make sure that the user running Plex Media Server has the correct permissions to the WebTools.bundle directory and it's contents.

**Note:** You cannot currently install WebTools on the Nvidia Shield TV. See the Plex [Nvidia Shield](https://forums.plex.tv/categories/nvidia-shield) forum for details.

Your Plug-ins folder should look something like this after manually installing WebTools.
