### install

If running Asustore, QNAP or Synology, take a peek here:
[Web Tools Installer](https://github.com/ukdtom/WTInstaller/releases/latest)

And if not, or if you want's to do it manually, follow this:

* [download it](https://github.com/dagalufh/WebTools.bundle/releases/latest) 
* Extract the zip file
* Copy the extracted files to the [Plug-ins directory](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201106098)
* Make sure, that it ends up in a directory named WebTools.bundle (And **NOT WebTools.bundle-master**)
* Make sure, that there's a directory just below the above mentioned, named "Contents". If not, then you might be one directory to high!


***

Then wait 2 min. and then refresh the Plex Web Admin interface, and if WebTools doesn't show as a Channel. then restart your Plex Media Server
