To install this plugin, you have two options:

* [The Unsupported Appstore](https://forums.plex.tv/index.php/topic/25523-unsupported-as-in-totally-unofficial-appstore/)
* To install the plugin manually (See futher down on this page)

***

Manual install:

* [download it](https://github.com/dagalufh/WebTools.bundle/archive/master.zip) 
* Extract the zip file
* Copy the extracted files to the [Plugin directory](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201106098)
* Make sure, that it ends up in a directory named WebTools.bundle (And **NOT WebTools.bundle-master**)
* Make sure, that there's a directory just below the above mentioned, named "Contents". If not, then you might be one directory to high!

Then wait 2 min. and then refresh the Plex Web Admin interface, and if WebTools doesn't show as a Channel. then restart your Plex Media Server
