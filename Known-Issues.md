On this page, you can find a list of known issues with the latest version of WebTools

## Logs
Note that some 3rd Party plugins use their own log routines, like Sub-Zero, and because of that, the highlighting of lines, where an error occurred, might fail when viewing those logs.

## Subs
If running Mac OSX, then deletion of subtitles has sadly been disabled in WebTools V3.0.0, due to code not yet finalized for that platform
