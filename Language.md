Clicking on the Language menu button will present you with the following screen:

![](https://github.com/ukdtom/WebTools.bundle/blob/master/Wiki/WebTools/Language/L-image01.png)

Here you can change the language that WebTools uses to display the text with. You will notice the drop down menu where you may select your desired language and you may also notice that beside any given language there is a percentage shown in brackets (99%).

The percentage indicates how many text strings have been converted to that language.

If the percentage for your language is not 100%, it means that we have not yet translated all the strings to your language, and as such we could use your help [here](https://poeditor.com/join/project/8uRxEmAE4M).

Clicking on the 'Force Language Translation Update` button will update your language with what's current on the translation site

All text strings start out as English, but by clicking on the [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/join/project/8uRxEmAE4M) link, you can join up to help correct the text strings for your language and change those English text strings to text strings in your language.
