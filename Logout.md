You may ask why a Logout button is needed, but if your WebTools is running on a publicly available server or you simply want to keep prying eyes from messing with your server, then WebTools provides this invaluable option.

When you click on logout, WebTools will do just that, log you out and the next time you open WebTools you will be required to log in again and thereby keep your server from those prying eyes and keep your server and settings from being tampered with.

Just remember, in order to keep your server and WebTools secure, always click on the logout button before closing your web browser.
