# ![Logo](https://github.com/ukdtom/WebTools.bundle/blob/master/Wiki/WebTools/Logos/WebTools-48x48.png) Factory Reset

The Factory Reset will return WebTools to the same condition it was in, the very first time you installed WebTools.

This can be useful if a plug-in has become lost to WebTools or if some unknown plug-in has failed to migrate or for many other issues.

You will need to migrate your previously installed plug-ins once again after using the Factory Reset button.
