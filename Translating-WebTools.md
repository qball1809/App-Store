# ![Logo](https://github.com/ukdtom/WebTools.bundle/blob/master/Wiki/WebTools/Logos/WebTools-48x48.png) Translating WebTools

If you decided to sign up for translating WebTools, then please note the following:

Sadly, we have seen, that some people sign up, get's added to WebTools about page, but never translate anything :-1: 

We do find this so unfair to people, that works hard to translate, and we as such have to react on this...

So this is the deal, when signing up....

When you sign up for translating one or more languages for WebTools, we do expect, that at least one string is translated!

As such, if after 14 days after the signup, we will look at the work you have done, and if it's nothing, you will be removed again from the translation list, as well as been blocked from signing up again
