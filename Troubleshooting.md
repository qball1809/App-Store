***
## Webpage gives an 404 error

This might be caused by Plex updating their WebClient.bundle
If this happens, go to the settings of your WebTools.bundle, confirm the IP Address, and press save.
Note....If running PMS on windows, you'll have to run the CMD file again. See [installation guide](https://github.com/dagalufh/WebTools.bundle/wiki/Installation)
