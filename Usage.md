### First launch:
Open Preferences for the WebTools channel in Plex to change the ports to use to access this.
If you change the defaults, the PMS will sadly hang, and and a PMS restart is needed.
After that, you'll be good.

### Regular usage:
Go to http://your-pms:33400 or https://your-pms:33443
(Above is the default ports)
On the left side you have the sections and options listed.
- Options persist between sessions.

After selecting a section, simply select the subtitles you want removed and press delete.
When deletion is complete, you get the option to refresh the section in Plex.

This will take some time depending on the size of your section. You can watch the activity log for live information about this in Plex.

After this the subtitles should be gone from the selected movie/episode.
