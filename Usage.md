### First launch:
Open Prefrences for the WebTools channel in Plex and enter the adress (IP or hostname) to your Plex Media Server.

### Regular usage:
Go to http://your-pms:32400/web/WebTools/index.html
On the left side you have the sections and options listed.
- Options persist between sessions.

After selecting a section, simply select the subtitles you want removed and press delete.
When deletion is complete, you get the option to refresh the section in Plex.

This will take some time depending on the size of your section. You can watch the activity log for live information about this in Plex.

After this the subtitles should be gone from the selected movie/episode.
