## Logging

If you create an issue here, we might ask you for a log from the plug-in

To locate the log, look here: [PMS Logs](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/200250417-Log-File-Locations) in case you can't grap it from the WebTools interface

Then locate the ones named : "com.plexapp.plugins.WebTools.log" and could also be followed by a .number
Logs can be provided to us publicly here, or if private is preferred, by [Plex forums or in a PM](https://github.com/dagalufh/WebTools.bundle/wiki/Contact)

Specific note on unRaid/Docker
